This two-day hackfest, co-organised by the R Epidemics Consortium (<a href='https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/'>RECON</a>) and the EPIET Alumni Network (<a href='https://epietalumni.net'>EAN</a>), will bring together seasoned field epidemiologists and R developers for two purposes: 

1. document case studies for online distribution and 
2. generate automated situation reports for your data

> **All data will be treated as confidential. We have no interest in publishing data or using it for any other purpose beyond generating automated sitreps.**

The event will take place in the [Mater Dei Hospital](#location) Malta, 24-25 November 2018, as a satellite event to the [ESCAIDE](https://www.escaide.eu/en) conference.  Both days will begin at 9AM and end at 5PM.  The hackfest will be aimed at people currently undertaking, or having recently completed, a field-epidemiology training programme (FETP), with some interest in epidemics analysis using R.  Applications should be sent using the providing form (see 'Register' tab above).
