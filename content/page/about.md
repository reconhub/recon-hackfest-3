Automated sitrep generation was identified as one of the <a href='https://github.com/RECON-gathering-March-2018/projects/issues/13'>key projects in the March 2018 RECON gathering mini-hack.</a> One of the most difficult aspects of automated sitrep generation is the fact that not all linelists record the same variables or have different names for the columns.
